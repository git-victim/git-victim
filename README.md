### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for checking out my profile...

I am a MERN Stack Developer and Aspiring blockchain Developer. I have worked as a freelance frontend developer and I also Interned at Apex Technology S.E Ltd as a Front-end Developer. I am a highly self-motivated Individual & my goal as a software developer is to write neat, high performing, well structured and reusable code. 

I've worked on projects covering a range of stacks which I have great interest in such as creating responsive user interfaces, creating restful APIs using server and serverless technologies and writing smart contracts to the ethereum blockchain.

When I'm not writing code or trying to figure out a solution to a software problem, I like to cook up a storm in the kitchen, play video games, basketball and hangout with my family or friends.
